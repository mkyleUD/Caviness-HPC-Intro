## {{ site.host_location }}'s HPC Wiki
The [HPC Documentation Wiki](https://docs.hpc.udel.edu/) provides details of IT-supported hardware and software environments, instructions and tutorials on their use, and their organizational and administrative structure for the IT Research Computing community clusters


## Submit a help desk ticket

If our online resources do not contain an answer to your question, then you can submit a help desk
ticket. This can be done in one of two ways. You can visit 
[UD's Service Portal](https://blog.trustedci.org/2021/04/trusted-ci-webinar-arizona-states.html )
and submit a "Research Computing Help Request". Alternatively you can email `askit@udel.edu`. 
That email be generate a help desk ticket automatically. There is a slight delay in when the RCI 
team receives that ticket, since the email is sent to the general IT help desk, who will than 
reassign it to IT-RCI.

## Google Groups
{{site.host_location}}'s IT-RCI team has created several Google Groups. These groups are 
there to help disseminate important information about the clusters to the users. This information
can be about training or answering questions. They groups can also be used by {{site.host_name}} 
users to discuss and help each other with problem they are having.

### `hpc-ask` Group
The [`hpc-ask` Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/udel.edu/g/hpc-ask) is there for all community
cluster users to ask questions, start discussions and share an upcoming event with the
community We encourage anyone in the community who might have an answer to a posted help 
request to share their answer. If a help request goes unanswered a member of the IT-RCI 
team will try answer it. 

### `{{ site.host_name }}-Users` Group
The [`{{site.host_name}}` Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/udel.edu/g/caviness-users) is there for
all {{ site.host_name}} users to discuss and ask questions about the {{ site.host_name }} cluster. The 
IT-RCI team will post about on training events, and important information about maintenance windows, and
