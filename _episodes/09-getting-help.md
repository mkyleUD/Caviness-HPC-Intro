## {{ site.host_location }}'s HPC Wiki

The login node is often very busy managing lots of users logged in, creating and editing files
and compiling software! It doesn’t have any extra space to run computational work.

Don’t run jobs on the login node (though quick tests are generally fine). A “quick test” is
generally anything that uses less than 5 minutes of time. If you
use too much resource then other users on the login node will start to be affected - their
login sessions will start to run slowly and may even freeze or hang. 

> ## Login nodes are a shared resource
>
> Remember, the login node is shared with all other users and your actions could cause
> issues for other people. Think carefully about the potential implications of issuing
> commands that may use large amounts of resource.

## Google Groups
{{site.host_location}}'s IT-RCI team has created several Google Groups. These groups are 
there to help disseminate important information about the clusters to the users. This information
can be about training or answering questions. They groups can also be used by {{site.host_name}} 
users to discuss and help each other with problem they are having.

### `hpc-ask` Group
The `hpc-ask` google groups is there for all community cluster users to request help about an issue
they might be having. We encourage anyone in the community who might have an answer to a posted help
request to share their answer. If a help request goes unanswered a member of the IT-RCI team will try
answer it. 

### `{{ site.host_name }}-Users` Group
The `{{site.host_name}}` 

## Email `askit@udel.edu`
For question about adding software packages, software updates, and account related questions, IT created the `askit@udel.edu` email account. Any question sent to that email address will be screened
and than a ticket will be created. From there all HPC related tickets are assigned to the IT-RCI team. 
After that, the best person will respond and address the ticket.
